# SPIDisplayKit
Objective-C Framework for using Dot Matrix Displays on Single Board Computers (Raspberry PI, SPI, PCD8544)

This Framework allows you to access the LCD Display using GPIO pins.
Specifically, this works with
- Raspberry PI ("official")
- PCD8544 based Displays (Nokia 3310/5110 Display)



This work starts from the C work:
"PCD8544 Library for Raspberry Pi"
https://binerry.de/post/25787954149/pcd8544-library-for-raspberry-pi

So as this "predecessor" it needs the wiringPI library: http://wiringpi.com/
The future of it is not certain, however. I worked the past year to get this working and I am based on this excellent library.
